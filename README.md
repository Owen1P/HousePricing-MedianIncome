This is a U.S. Housing Market Affordability Project that I and my group created! 

Housing affordability has become a pressing issue in the United States. Over the past few decades, the cost of buying a home has risen much faster than household incomes, leading to an ever-widening gap between housing prices and what the average family earns

Higher values indicate that home prices are high relative to incomes, signaling reduced affordability for the typical household. Given this context, our analysis addresses “U.S. Housing Price vs. Average Income” with the goal of understanding and modeling the relationship between housing prices and household incomes over time.

Open access: All data, code, and documentation are available for full transparency and reproducibility.  

What you’ll find:
  * Jupyter notebook with every code cell and markdown explanation.  
  * Raw and processed datasets.  
  * Additional scripts and helper functions.  
How to use it:  
  1. Clone the repo or download the notebook, install the listed Python packages, and launch the notebook.  
  2. Download the dataset and make sure it is in the same file path as the notebook
  3. Re-run cells to reproduce every figure, table, and model evaluation.  
  4. Fork or branch to test new features, add variables, or try different algorithms.
